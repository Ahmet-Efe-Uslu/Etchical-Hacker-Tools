LocalEye

LocalEye is a powerful LAN scanner designed to be the favorite tool of ethical hackers.
Important: Unauthorized or illegal use of this project is a serious crime.

Features:

Attempts to retrieve MAC addresses with about a 5-10% success rate, but even if it does, it doesn't display them.

Works completely without root privileges.

Displays IP addresses and open ports of devices on the local network.

Uses ports, MAC addresses (with low probability), and other data to make educated guesses about the operating system.

Extremely powerful: if it wants to get an IP address, it tries 3-5 different methods — practically impossible to avoid.

Fast — completes scans in about 5 seconds.

Can identify devices like modems and more.

And much more...
